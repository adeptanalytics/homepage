                          giving men and women equal power to shape their own lives and contribute to their 
                          families, communities, and countries. And yet, critical gender gaps continue to exist in 
                          all countries and across multiple dimensions.</P>
                          <P>The gender module of the World Bank's ADePT software platform produces a comprehensive 
                          set of tables and graphs using household surveys to help diagnose and analyze the 
                          prevailing gender inequalities at the country level and over time. This book provides a 
                          step-by-step guide to the use of the ADePT software and an introduction to its basic 
                          economic concepts and econometric methods.</P>
                          <P>The module is organized around the framework proposed by the <em>World Development Report
                          2012: Gender Equality and Development</em>. It covers gender differences in outcomes in 
                          three primary dimensions of gender equality: human capital (or endowments), economic 
                          opportunities, and voice and agency. Particular focus is given to the analysis and 
                          decomposition techniques that allow for further exploring of gender gaps in economic 
                          opportunities.</P>

                          Indicators Module. The analytical framework and approach taken up in this book are based 
                          on the ILO's Key Indicators of the Labour Market (KILM). KILM indicators provide a strong 
                          basis on which to address key questions related to productive employment and decent work. 
                          The ADePT ILO Labor Market Indicators Module is a powerful tool for producing and 
                          analyzing KILM indicators using household survey data. The software allows researchers 
                          and practitioners to automate data production, to minimize data production errors, and 
                          to quickly produce a wide range of labor market data from labor force surveys or other 
                          household surveys that contain labor market information.</P>

                          Applications</em> is a comprehensive guide for analyzing and understanding the effects of 
                          macroeconomic shocks on income and consumption distribution, as well as using the ADePT 
                          Simulation Module. Since real-time micro data is rarely available, the Simulation Module
                          (part of the ADePT economic analysis software) takes advantage of historical household
                          surveys to estimate how current or proposed macro changes might impact household and 
                          individuals welfare. Using examples from different economic and social contexts, the book 
                          explains macro-micro linkages in an easy and intuitive way. After developing a sound 
                          theoretical foundation, readers are then shown how to explore their own scenarios using the 
                          Simulation Module. Step-by-step instructions illustrate data entry and show how to make 
                          adjustments using the Module's options. Exercises present how different sections of the 
                          simulation process operate independently. This book will be a valuable reference for 
                          analysts needing to evaluate the potential impact of structural reforms and to generate 
                          projections for hypothetical scenarios. Results created by the Simulation Module will be 
                          helpful in informing governmental policymaking.</P>

              	<P>ADePT Health allows users to produce quickly and with a
                minimal risk of errors most tables that have become
                standard in applied health equity analysis. ADePT's tables
                are in a standardized format and are based on a set of
                methods that are widely accepted in the literature. However,
                ADePT Health also allows considerable flexibility in terms
                of specific assumptions. Through its standardized tables,
                ADePT Health facilitates comparisons of health equity over
                time within and between countries.</P>

                Stata do files for analysts who are comfortable with Stata
                programming. ADePT Health will appeal to the health equity
                analyst who wants to focus on data-preparation, interpreting
                results, and thinking about policy implications, rather than
                on Stata programming. ADePT Health dramatically reduces the
                time taken to prepare standard health equity tables, and
                makes more widely accessible all the methods covered in

              	<P>ADePT Education was developed as a joint effort of 
                EdStats and DECRG. The purpose of this new tool is to 
                pull common educational indicators out of microlevel 
                survey data and present it in a print-ready form, 
                facilitating further analysis by researchers. 
                Using ADePT, a researcher can access over 15 predefined 
                tables that present information on over 30 educational 
                indicators. These indicators are disaggregated by such 
                categories as level of education, gender, area of 
                residence (urban/rural), household wealth, and the 
                gender and educational level of household head. Tables 
                are also grouped into categories: school participation, 
                progression, attainment, and education expenditures. 
                ADePT Education also provides 30 graphs on educational

              	<H3>Food Security</H3>
              	<P>Since the end of the Second World War, the international community
                has been focusing on reducing the number and the proportion of
                people who suffer from hunger. Over time it became clear that no
                single indicator would provide a comprehensive picture of the food
                security situation. Rather, a suite of indicators is necessary to
                describe food insecurity in all its dimensions. The demand for
                evidence based policies, which brings together providers such as
                statistical offices and users of food security indicators including
                policy makers and researchers, has also been increasing. The ADePT-Food 
                Security Module (ADePT-FSM) was developed to produce food security 
                indicators from food consumption data collected in household surveys (HS). 
                These indicators include the consumption of calories and macronutrients, 
                the availability of micronutrients and amino acids, the distribution of 
                calories and the proportion of people undernourished.</P>
                
                <P>ADePT-FSM requires four datasets. Three of them contain data extracted 
                from the original HS files, including household and household members'
                characteristics, and quantities and monetary values of food commodities
                consumed by households. The fourth datasets contains calorie and nutrients
                conversion factors extracted from national/regional Food Composition Tables.</P>

                <P>The food security indicators are derived at the national and subnational
                levels such as by region, area of residence or household heads' 
                characteristics. ADePT-FSM also produces statistics by group of food items 
                and at the food item level. Some National Food Insecurity Reports are

                <P>ADePT Agriculture was developed to facilitate the computation
                and production of agricultural statistics and indicators from
                household and farm survey data. It generates print-ready tables
                that describe the characteristics of the agricultural sector,
                and the factors that affect agricultural productivity. ADePT
                Agriculture is designed for use with household level data, but
                can be equally used with data from surveys that sample farms
                rather than households. ADePT Agriculture consists of two
                modules focusing respectively on crops and livestock.</P>

                <P>The tool is intended for use by policy analysts, agricultural
                ministries staff, NGOs and international organizations and
                researchers interested in getting a better understanding of the
                farm household economy. By making it simpler and faster to
                produce analytical reports, ADePT Agriculture frees up
                resources for the interpretation of results, and facilitates
                using data to design evidence based policies and investments.
                By making the analysis easier and faster for a wider range of
                users, ADePT Agriculture can also increase the demand for and
                utilization of new and existing household survey data.</P>

                <P>ADePT Agriculture was developed in cooperation with the

                policy analysis. In particular the module generate tables on
                farm structures, land use, tenancy arrangement status, by regions
                and over expenditure and land quintiles. It also generates tables
                on land quality features, the use of agricultural inputs and
                services, crop production and income, and constraints to crop
                production.</P>

                to household's livelihoods, including through the provision of cash
                income, food, manure, draft power and hauling services, savings and
                insurance and social status. The Livestock module automates and
                standardizes the analysis of survey data and the production of
                analytical tables on the livestock sector. ADePT Agriculture -
                Livestock generates a set of tables that describe the key
